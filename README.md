# dietary-delivery-manova-analysis
This project uses one-way MANOVA to examine whether delivery mode (online, in-person, video) influences patient ratings of difficulty, usefulness, and importance of dietary information. Assumptions are tested and post-hoc analyses conducted to assess whether delivery format impacts overall patient perception in healthcare communication.
